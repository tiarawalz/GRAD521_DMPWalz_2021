# Data Description

The data used for this research will be a derived dataset from two datasets: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Both are publicly available, deidentified datasets (panel designed surveys) that collect health and healthcare specific questions/answers from American families and individuals, their medical providers (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, etc), and employers across The United States. MEPS and NHIS collect data on the specific health services that Americans use, how frequently they are used, the costs associated with services, and how they are paid for, as well as data on the cost, scope, and breadth of health insurance held by and available to workers. MEPS is seen as the most complete source of data on the cost and use of health care in the United States and on U.S. health insurance coverage. These surveys are valuable tools for tracking progress in the effort to expand access to health care and insurance coverage. 

Data is publicly available in data tables, downloadable data files (person, job, event, or condition level), annually projected expenditures through 2018, and through interactive data tools, as well as in publications using healthcare data. The MEPS sample is drawn from the NHIS sample of the prior year. The derived dataset will be 1 TB in size and we will use STATA 16 to analyze it.

# Roles and responsibilities

There is only one person managing this process. I am responsible for the implementation of the Data Management Plan, since this will be for my dissertation work. Additional responsibilities for this project will be archiving and preservation, data manager, data collection/data generation where needed, data organization, metadata organization, quality control, and data analysis. I will be responsible for these roles. My advisor will have a role in overseeing how I work on the data, and the methods professor on my committee will assist in viewing the data and analysis/methods in order to help me with this part of the proposal/dissertation.
