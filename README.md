# GRAD521_DMPWalz_2021

Context of the project for this DMP: 

My project consists of using Medical Expenditure Panel Data and National Health Interview Survey data to explore the relationship between nonpharmacological treatment use in the American population and their pain levels and overall well-being.

My doctorate is in Public Health, with an emphasis in Health Policy. My big research interests are to improve the health and well-being of American citizens. I am still working on narrowing down my research questions for my dissertation research, but I am interested in looking at how pain impacts people in the United States. I am interested in pain levels as they relate to peoples’ well-being. I’m also interested in what types of nonpharmacological treatments people who experience pain may be using and if it improves their well-being more than just traditional healthcare visits. Nonpharmacological pain therapies are interventions that do not involve the use of medications to treat pain. My motivation in researching these therapies is inspired by the opioid addiction/abuse crisis in our country. 

This project is authorized by Tiara Walz for use on her dissertation.
